        <h3>Broadwick</h3>
        
        <p>Broadwick is a java framework for creating and running epidemiological models - 
	this probject will be going live before 24th June 2014.
	<br>Get the code from: <a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/Broadwick">https://github.com/EPICScotland/Broadwick</a>

	<h3>BroadwickTutorial</h3>

	<p>BroadwickTutorial contains tutorial materials on how to use the Broadwick Framework, 
	and includes code stubs that you convert into working code as part of the tutorial.  
	<br>Get the code from <a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/BroadwickTutorial">https://github.com/EPICScotland/BroadwickTutorial</a>
	</p>

	<h3>BroadwickExamples</h3>
	
	<p>BroadwickExamples contains some simple stochastic compartmental models written within the Broadwick framework. 
	<br>Get the code from <a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/BroadwickExamples">https://github.com/EPICScotland/BroadwickExamples</a>
	</p>

	<h3>MovementSimulations</h3>

	<p>The MovementSimulations repository is for movement simulation code and test data, and contains the AnimalMovementSimulations java project.  
	<p>The AnimalMovementSimulations project generates simulated animal movement data for use with Broadwick, 
	particularly for the BroadwickTutorial. 
	Since the examples are based upon the implemented Soho model (which uses Broadwick), 
	this project focuses on simulating cattle movements and CTS data, although different livestock scenarios might be added later. 
	<p>Please see the 
	<a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/MovementSimulations/raw/master/AnimalMovementSimulations/doc/AnimalMovementSimulations.pdf">AnimalMovementSimulations.pdf</a> 
	document in the AnimalMovementSimulations/doc folder for more information  
	on the source code and how to run the 
	<a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/MovementSimulations/raw/master/AnimalMovementSimulations/RandomMovementSimulator.jar">
	RandomMovementSimulator.jar</a> 
	command line java application. 
	<p>Example simulated cattle movement data can be found in the AnimalMovementSimulations/simulations folder.
