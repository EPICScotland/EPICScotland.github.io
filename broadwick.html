	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	
	<p>Broadwick is a framework for developing sophisticated epidemiological based mathematical models, and consists of several Java libraries and bespoke packages.  The components of Broadwick are written in such a way that a scientist may combine them in order to rapidly prototype a model for a new specific scenario.

	<p><b>Features</b>

	<ul>
	<li>Supports single (e.g. within herd) or structured populations (e.g. multi-species or locations)
	<li>Inclusion of movement over network data (e.g. Cattle movement Tracing System)
	<li>Stochastic Individual Based simulations (including fast approximate options)
	<li>Approximate Bayesian Computation inference for estimating model parameters from data via simulations
	<li>Monte Carol Markov Chain inference for estimating model parameters from data
	</ul>

	<h1>BroadwickExamples</h1>
	
	<p>BroadwickExamples contains some simple stochastic compartmental models written within the Broadwick framework. 
	<br>To run these you will need the built jar file 
	<a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/BroadwickExamples/raw/master/target/BroadwickExamples-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar">
	BroadwickExamples-1.0-SNAPSHOT.one-jar.jar</a> and the xml configuration files: 
	<a href="https://github.com/EPICScotland/BroadwickExamples">Broadwick_with_(XXX).xml</a></p>

	<p>Instructions for running the examples, and an outline of how to write your own (but see the tutorial above for detailed instructions) can be found in the 
	<a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/BroadwickExamples/tree/master/doc/">BroadwickExamples/doc</a> directory: 	
	<ul>
	<li><a href = "broadwickExamples/doc/HowTo_RunBroadwickExamples_QuickStart.pdf">HowTo_RunBroadwickExamples_QuickStart.pdf (19 June 2014)</a>

	</p>

	<h1>MovementSimulations</h1>

	<p>The MovementSimulations repository is for movement simulation code and test data, and contains the AnimalMovementSimulations java project.  
	<p>The AnimalMovementSimulations project generates simulated animal movement data for use with Broadwick, 
	particularly for the BroadwickTutorial. 
	Since the examples are based upon the implemented Soho model (which uses Broadwick), 
	this project focuses on simulating cattle movements and CTS data, although different livestock scenarios might be added later. 
	<p>Please see the 
	<a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/MovementSimulations/raw/master/AnimalMovementSimulations/doc/AnimalMovementSimulations.pdf">AnimalMovementSimulations.pdf</a> 
	document in the 
	<a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/MovementSimulations/tree/master/AnimalMovementSimulations/doc">AnimalMovementSimulations/doc</a> folder for more information  
	on the source code and how to run the 
	<a href = "https://github.com/EPICScotland/MovementSimulations/raw/master/AnimalMovementSimulations/RandomMovementSimulator.jar">
	RandomMovementSimulator.jar</a> 
	command line java application. 
	<p>Example simulated cattle movement data can be found in the 
	<a href ="https://github.com/EPICScotland/MovementSimulations/tree/master/AnimalMovementSimulations/simulations">
	AnimalMovementSimulations/simulations</a> folder.
